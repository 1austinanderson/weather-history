# Backstory
As a private pilot and small aircraft owner, one of the most exciting parts of my Summer 2017 move from New Hampshire to California was flying across the country. I had a blast stopping at small airports and towns along the way. Long-distance travel in a small plane is very different from flying on the airlines - you are much closer to the ground, so weather plays a much greater role in your experience. I knew that Monterey was famous for the summer marine layer - low fog that can persist for days at a time, making flying by small plane difficult or impossible. I just missed the "June Gloom", but as "No-Sky July" gave way to "Fogust", I wondered whether the weather would ever get better.

So I started looking for historical aviation weather data. It was a little difficult to find a source going back a few years! I found what I needed via NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information - they have an easy-to-use <a href="https://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/cdopoemain.cmd?datasetabbv=DS3505&countryabbv=&georegionabbv=&resolution=40">online interface</a> where I was able to grab years of data for Monterey's airport in CSV format. It didn't take long to get some visualizations working. (For the record, we started seeing mostly sunny days in late September).
